## *Studying JavaScript Code Competency in Open-Source Projects*

### What is this project about?

In this project, we intend to study JavaScript code competency in open-source projects by defining and evaluating JavaScript code competency using references from CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference, read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) to estimate the competency of programmers in the JavaScript programming language. Then, we create an automated tool for analyzing and reporting the detected JavaScript code competency. Lastly, we apply the tool to open-source projects to understand the competency of JavaScript code in real-world software projects.

### How does it work?
